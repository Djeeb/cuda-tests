# Projects

- [x] **tutorials** : simple programs to understand the syntax of libtorch.

- [x] **nnet_from_scratch** : implementing a 1-layer fully-connected neural network from scratch using only `torch::Tensor` structure. Mathematical and coding approach to understand the step-by-step basic methods of deep learning.

- [x] **SAGA_nnet** : Implementing customized gradient algorithm called SAGA and testing it versus SGD. Highlighting the
memory cost of using SAGA for neural networks. 

- [x] **SVRG_nnet** : Implementing customized gradient algorithm called SVRG and testing it versus SGD.
