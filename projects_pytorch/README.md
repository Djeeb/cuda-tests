# Projects

- [x] **tutorials** : simple programs to understand the syntax of libtorch. `c++`
- [x] **nnet_from_scratch** : implementing a 1-layer fully-connected neural network from scratch using only `torch::Tensor` structure. Mathematical and coding approach to understand the step-by-step basic methods of deep learning.
- [ ] **manual_vs_autograd** : comparing manual back-propagation vs autograd module from libtorch to check how fast it is. Mathematical considerations on automatic differentation.
